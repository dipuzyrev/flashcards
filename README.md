## Core features

## Idea behind the project
Oftentimes, English learners come across unfamiliar words while consuming English content and wish to save them for later memorization. A common recommendation is to create word definitions in English and include usage examples, which can sometimes be challenging and frustrating. This project aims to solve this problem with the help of ChatGPT.
